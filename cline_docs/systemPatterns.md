# System Patterns

## Architecture
The system will follow a client-server architecture. The front-end (VOX-UI) will be a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will use the UltraVox Client SDK to handle voice processing and will communicate with n8n via webhooks for backend functionality.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Use of UltraVox for voice processing
- Use of n8n for backend workflow automation
- Emulation of the ElevenLabs UI design for a clean and intuitive user experience
- Implementation of an animated orb that responds to voice activity
- Responsive design to support both desktop and mobile browsers
- Use of CSS transitions and animations for smooth interactions
- Implementation of a popup sidebar menu for navigation
- Use of semi-transparent overlays with blur effects

## Architecture Patterns
- **Client-Server:** The front-end will act as a client, sending requests to the backend (n8n) and receiving responses
- **API Integration:** The front-end will integrate with the UltraVox API for voice processing
- **Webhook Integration:** The front-end will use webhooks to communicate with n8n

## UI Patterns
- **Responsive Layout:** Consistent spacing and component sizes across screen sizes
- **Navigation:** Popup sidebar menu with overlay for main navigation
- **State Management:** Clear visual feedback for button states and interactions
- **Voice Interface:** Central orb with visual feedback for voice activity
- **Input Methods:** Dual input support with voice and text options
- **Visual Feedback:** Use of transitions and animations for user interactions
- **Mobile First:** Optimized touch targets and text handling for mobile devices
