# Product Context

## Project Goal
The goal of this project (VOX-UI) is to create a voice agent front-end interface that emulates the design of the ElevenLabs Voice agent UI. This interface will use UltraVox for voice processing and connect to n8n via a webhook for backend functionality.

## Problems Solved
This project aims to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for interacting with a voice agent. It will leverage the capabilities of UltraVox for voice processing and n8n for workflow automation.

## How it Should Work
The interface should allow users to interact with a voice agent through a clean and intuitive UI. It should include an animated element that responds to voice activity, similar to the ElevenLabs UI. The voice agent should be able to connect to tools via a webhook, enabling it to perform various tasks. The UI should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile browsers.
