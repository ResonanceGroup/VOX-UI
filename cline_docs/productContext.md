# Product Context

## Project Goal
The goal of this project (VOX-UI) is to create a voice agent front-end interface that emulates the design of the ElevenLabs Voice agent UI. This interface will use UltraVox for voice processing and connect to n8n via a webhook for backend functionality.

## Problems Solved
- Provides a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for voice agent interaction
- Offers multiple input methods (voice and text) for flexible user interaction
- Enables easy access to tools and settings through an organized menu system
- Provides clear visual feedback for voice activity and system states
- Maintains consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices

## How it Should Work

### Core Interface
- Central animated orb provides visual feedback for voice activity
- "Talk to interrupt" button allows immediate voice interaction
- Text input field offers alternative input method
