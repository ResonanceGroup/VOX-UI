# Current Issues

## Settings Page Layout
- Bottom spacing between buttons and screen edge is too large (currently 80px padding)
- Need to review and match text/styling with original design in src-old folder

## Theme Button Issues
- Theme button contrast issues:
  - In light mode: "Dark" button label has poor contrast
  - In dark mode: "Light" button label has poor contrast
- Button states need to be reviewed to ensure active/inactive states are clearly visible
