# Project Pivot (April 2025)

## Recent Changes
- **Project Direction Shift:** The project's focus has pivoted from building a standalone voice assistant backend (RunPod/UltraVox/Kokoro) to creating a voice UI (VOX UI) that acts as a frontend controller for the Roo Code VSCode extension via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Previous Backend Work Deferred:** All work related to the RunPod infrastructure, UltraVox, and Kokoro TTS integration is now deferred indefinitely.
- **Phase 1 (MCP Page HTML/CSS) Complete:** The initial HTML structure and CSS styling for the MCP Server settings page (`src/mcp_settings.html`) are complete, including sample data. JS logic and minor CSS tweaks deferred.
- **UI Finalization - Phase A Complete:** Settings Page Overhaul (`src/settings.html`) completed with new sections (Voice Agent, MCP, n8n, General UI) and controls.

## Current Focus: UI Finalization Plan

Following the plan outlined in `cline_docs/ui_finalization_plan.md`:

### Phase A: Settings Page Overhaul (Complete)
- **Status:** `src/settings.html` restructured with new sections and controls.

### Phase B: MCP Page Integration (In Progress)
- **Goal:** Integrate the MCP settings page icon.
- **Tasks:**
    1. Retrieve MCP Icon SVG from Roo Code source. (Next Step)
    2. Update `src/mcp_settings.html` sidebar link with the correct icon.

### Phase C: Theme Persistence Bug Fix
- **Goal:** Diagnose and fix the global theme application issue.

### Phase 2 (Original Plan): Enhance Visualizations (Deferred)
- This phase (including status indicators) will be addressed after the UI Finalization Plan is complete.

### Phase 3 (Original Plan): Backend Implementation (Deferred)
- Design a robust backend architecture focused on supporting the MCP-centric UI and communication with Roo Code (details TBD).
- Implement backend code needed for UI features (e.g., potentially handling MCP config file interactions, relaying commands if necessary).

### Phase 4 (Original Plan): MCP Server for Roo Code (Deferred)
- Build the specific MCP server required to interact with Roo Code's WebSocket API.

# Next Steps

1.  **Begin Phase B:** Search for the MCP Icon SVG within the Roo Code source directory (`C:\Users\Jason\source\repos\Roo-Code`).
