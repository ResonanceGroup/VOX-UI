# Project Pivot (April 2025)

## Recent Changes
- **Project Direction Shift:** The project's focus has pivoted from building a standalone voice assistant backend (RunPod/UltraVox/Kokoro) to creating a voice UI (VOX UI) that acts as a frontend controller for the Roo Code VSCode extension via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Previous Backend Work Deferred:** All work related to the RunPod infrastructure, UltraVox, and Kokoro TTS integration is now deferred indefinitely.
- **Phase 1 Complete (HTML/CSS):** The initial HTML structure and CSS styling for the MCP Server settings page (`src/mcp_settings.html`) are complete.
- **Settings Page Overhaul Complete:** Restructured `src/settings.html` with new sections (Voice Agent, MCP, n8n, General UI), styled section groups, updated primary color for better contrast, and addressed layout/spacing issues.
## Current Focus: Phased UI Development for Roo Code Integration

The development will proceed in the following phases:

### Phase 1: MCP Server Page UI (HTML/CSS Complete)
- **Goal:** Implement an MCP Server settings page in the VOX UI (target file: `src/mcp_settings.html`).
- **Status:** HTML structure and CSS styling implemented, including sample data. JS logic and minor CSS tweaks deferred.

### Phase 2: Enhance Visualizations (In Progress)
- **Goal:** Improve visual feedback in the main chat UI.
- **Tasks:**
    1. Brainstorm visual representation and placement for status indicators (MCP Connection, Roo Code Status). (Current Task)
    2. Add placeholder HTML elements for status indicators.
    3. Style the status indicators.
    4. Define common UI elements for consistency.
    5. Update the current UI prototype to incorporate enhanced UI elements.
    6. Implement JavaScript for dynamic status updates.

### Phase 3: Backend Implementation
- Design a robust backend architecture focused on supporting the MCP-centric UI and communication with Roo Code (details TBD).
- Implement backend code needed for UI features (e.g., potentially handling MCP config file interactions, relaying commands if necessary).

### Phase 4: MCP Server for Roo Code
- Build the specific MCP server required to interact with Roo Code's WebSocket API.

# Next Steps

1.  **Continue Phase 2:** Brainstorm visual representation and placement for status indicators (MCP Connection, Roo Code Status) in the main chat UI (`src/index.html`).
